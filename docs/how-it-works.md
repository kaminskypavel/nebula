# How it works

<sub>[← README](../README.md) · [Keys](keys.md) · [Commands](commands.md) · [Sessions](sessions.md) · [Configuration](configuration.md) · [How it works](how-it-works.md)</sub>

- **Detached daemon (tmux-style).** A background `nebula` daemon owns every PTY, so agents keep running
  when the TUI closes. The TUI is a client that attaches over a unix socket (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nebula/`
  or `/tmp/nebula-<uid>/`, mode 0700). Quit the TUI, relaunch later, and your sessions are still alive
  with scrollback replayed. When the daemon swaps the process under a session you are looking at — a
  restart, or the `nebula worktree` relocation at the end of a turn — the pane is rebound to the new
  one on its own. Moving the cursor onto a live session — a row in the Sessions panel, or a worktree,
  project or workspace switch that brings one back — attaches it on the keypress; only a session the
  idle reaper took waits a moment, so that walking past its row doesn't boot a CLI. The screens of the
  last two sessions shown are kept, so returning to one paints on the same frame and fetches only the
  bytes it missed instead of replaying the whole ring.
- **Every pane is the same truecolor terminal.** A session paints nebula's own grid, not the terminal
  nebula runs in, so the daemon tells each child `TERM=xterm-256color` and `COLORTERM=truecolor` and
  drops any `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR` it inherited. An agent launch runs through your login shell
  (`$SHELL -l -i -c 'unset …; export …; claude …'`) so it sees your real PATH — and your aliases and
  functions: a `claude` that `.zshrc` reroutes through a wrapper launches exactly as it does when typed
  — and restates all three after your profile has run. Claude Code takes a stray `NO_COLOR` —
  exported by the agent shell the daemon was first started from, or by a login-only profile no
  interactive terminal sources — as "no colour" and paints its whole UI in the default foreground while
  the TUI around it stays coloured; the TUI still honours its own `NO_COLOR` on the way out, so a user
  who wants none keeps none.
- **Client and DAEMON must agree on the PROTOCOL VERSION.** IPC frames are positional msgpack, so any
  change to the shared types bumps `PROTOCOL_VERSION` (`crates/nebula-core/src/protocol.rs`) and the
  handshake refuses a mismatched pair — the DAEMON answers `Incompatible`, the TUI bails, and the
  VERSION SKEW message names both binaries. Which side is stale decides the fix, and getting it
  backwards costs an afternoon: when the DAEMON is the *older* build, `nebula kill` and relaunch is the
  whole remedy (it stops every live session on the way). A DAEMON that can't take the `Shutdown`
  request gets SIGTERM instead, at the pid the kernel reports on the other end of the socket or, when
  it can't say, at the pid in its pidfile — which can't come first, because macOS's tmp cleaner deletes
  regular files in `/tmp` after three idle days but spares sockets, so the DAEMON touches its pidfile
  hourly and puts it back if it vanishes. When the DAEMON is *ahead* of the `nebula` you
  just ran, `nebula kill` does nothing for you — a live instance respawns its DAEMON from its own
  binary, so the skew survives every restart, and the fix is to install the DAEMON's build over yours
  (`make install` from that checkout) instead. The usual shape in a checkout is a `make dev` DAEMON out
  of `target/debug` while your PATH still finds an older `nebula` from the last `make install`.
- **RECENCY ORDER stamps every row.** A session is stamped when it last did anything, a worktree carries
  the newest stamp of its sessions, and a project the newest of its worktrees — which is why the lists
  sort themselves most-recent-first. The one fixed seat is the ROOT WORKTREE, always the first worktree
  row.
- **Projects → worktrees → sessions.** All work happens in the main checkout or a git worktree.
  Worktrees are real (`git worktree add/remove`), created under
  `<repo>/../<repo-name>-worktrees/<branch>` and branched from the freshly fetched `origin/HEAD`
  unless `nebula worktree --base` names another start — a branch origin has means origin's fetched
  copy, so `--base main` is `origin/main` and never the checkout's local `main` (no `origin`, or a
  fetch that fails: the checkout's HEAD). The `worktree_base_branch` SETTING (Settings → General)
  is a standing `--base` for every worktree nobody names one for — `master` for a repo whose
  default branch is not what origin says, or that has no origin — resolved the same way, and
  falling back to `origin/HEAD` in a repo that has no branch of that name.
- **Worktrees made outside nebula show up anyway — WORKTREE SYNC.** Every 2 s the DAEMON mtime-probes
  the git files a worktree operation touches — the repo's shared `.git/HEAD`, the `.git/worktrees`
  directory, and each linked checkout's own `HEAD` — and only when the newest of those stamps has moved
  does it spend a `git worktree list` and reconcile the rows. So an agent that runs `git worktree add`
  itself, a `git checkout` you did in another terminal, or a worktree someone removed lands in the
  panel within a couple of seconds without a restart, while an idle repo costs nothing but a few
  `stat` calls (`NEBULA_WORKTREE_SYNC_MS` overrides the 2 s beat; the e2e tests turn it down to
  100 ms). This structural sync is the *only* git polling the DAEMON does — the pull request lookups
  further down are the TUI's own.
- **The root checkout changes branch in place — the BRANCH SWITCHER.** `c` on the ROOT WORKTREE (or
  from the Projects panel) lists the repo's branches with one `git for-each-ref` and switches with
  `git switch`, asking first when the checkout has uncommitted changes whether to stash, bring along,
  commit or discard them. That git is the TUI's, like the diff viewer's: the writes and the background
  `git fetch --all` run in a session of their own with stdin closed, so an `ssh` passphrase prompt fails
  instead of painting over the screen, and the TUI renames the root row the moment git says yes. The
  WORKTREE SYNC above then sees the moved `.git/HEAD` and confirms the branch from the DAEMON's side.
  Linked worktrees don't switch: each is named after the branch it was cut for.
- **A worktree's outside resources are yours to hook — WORKTREE HOOKS.** `git config
  nebula.worktreeCreateHook` / `nebula.worktreeDeleteHook` name an executable the DAEMON runs after it
  creates or removes a checkout, from the main repository, with the repo path and the worktree path as
  its two arguments — so a project can claim a dev-server port or a Caddy route on create and release
  it on delete. The hook runs after the git operation and the row change have gone through, still
  under the worktree lock — so hooks never overlap and a create of a path waits for the delete hook
  releasing it — and under a 30 s timeout that kills the hook and everything it started; a failure is
  a warning in every client, never a rolled-back create or delete. Per repo in git config rather than in CONFIG.JSON, and never a file inside the
  checkout. See [Configuration](configuration.md#worktree-hooks).
- **A worktree runs its own project — the PROJECT FILE.** A committed `.nebula.json` names a `run` and
  an `open` command. `r` on a worktree has the DAEMON start `run` in a RUN TERMINAL — a terminal row
  that carries its command and spawns `$SHELL -l -i -c '<run>'` instead of an interactive shell — so the
  PTY's life is the worktree's RUNNING state, broadcast as that terminal's `alive` and drawn as the
  row's `▶ running`; `r` again kills the process tree and drops the row. The idle reaper and the prewarm
  sweep leave that terminal alone, and a run that exits on its own keeps its PTY, so an attach replays
  the ending instead of respawning — a command starts only on the keypress. `Shift+Enter` (or `Shift+O`) runs `open`
  once, from the TUI. See [Configuration](configuration.md#the-project-file-nebulajson).
- **Agents boot `claude`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`, `pi`, `muse`, or a custom registry program.** Creating an agent (`n`) first asks which CLI to
  run, then spawns it in the worktree. Claude's picker can also dispatch a one-shot Cloud task as
  `claude --cloud <task>`; because Claude accepts that description as a process argument, don't put
  secrets in the Cloud task. That CLI prints the new session's id and exits, and the DAEMON reads the
  id off its output — the agent then runs in Claude's cloud, so the row's pane is the CLOUD SESSION
  PANEL linking to it, and nothing is ever attached, teleported or restarted locally in its name.
  Restored agents resume with `claude --resume <session-id>` /
  `codex resume <session-id>` / `cursor-agent --resume <session-id>` (falling back to a fresh session
  when the old one is gone) / `pi --session-id <session-id>` (which creates a missing id instead of
  dying); `muse` always boots fresh (no resume flag mapped yet). A session's id is saved only once a turn has run in it — the CLI writes the transcript a
  resume reads on the first prompt — so a CLI booted and never used resumes as nothing. Claude
  ids are checked against the transcripts on disk before the spawn, and one with none boots fresh;
  any resume that exits with an error within 10 s of its spawn is respawned fresh, unless its Claude
  transcript is still there (then the id is kept, and the pane shows why the CLI quit). An AGENT created from a PROJECT OPEN PRS row also receives the PR URL and a PR-only
  work rule — Claude and Pi through `--append-system-prompt` on every spawn, Codex, Cursor and Muse as the first prompt of
  their cold spawn (their transcripts carry it through a resume); nebula persists that URL. An AGENT
  launched from the ISSUES MODAL (`i`) carries the GitHub issue's URL the same way — persisted with
  the row, rebuilt into an issue-context rule on every spawn and resume — so the harness knows which
  issue the session is for (see [Sessions](sessions.md#the-issues-modal-and-issue-sessions)).
- **Status via agent-CLI hooks, not MCP.** At agent spawn, nebula merges managed hooks into the
  worktree's `.claude/settings.local.json` (Claude Code) or `.cursor/hooks.json` (Cursor CLI), and into
  `~/.codex/hooks.json` (Codex — codex records hook approvals against the hook file's path, so a
  per-worktree file would re-prompt forever; from its home, you approve nebula's hooks once at codex's
  "Hooks need review" prompt and every later worktree is silent). Groups are tagged `_nebulaManaged`,
  user hooks preserved, rebuilt each spawn. Each hook is a fail-soft curl to the daemon's loopback HTTP
  endpoint, authenticated with a per-boot bearer token injected into the agent's environment only.
- **…plus the progress bar, for the cancel no hook reports.** Escaping out of a turn fires no `Stop` and
  suppresses the idle notification that normally un-sticks one, so nebula also reads the CLI's terminal
  progress-bar escapes (OSC 9;4) straight off the PTY. That signal survives a cancel, and it stays busy
  while a permission prompt is open — so it can't mark an agent done while it is actually waiting on you.
- **…and the IDLE PROMPT, which is a hold rather than a finish.** Claude posts a
  `Notification{idle_prompt}` after roughly 60 s parked at the input box with nobody touching the
  keyboard, and that is the notification which un-sticks a turn that ended without a `Stop` — a
  rejected prompt, an escape mid-turn. Since Claude Code 2.1 the Agent tool runs subagents in the
  *background*, so it also fires while workers are still going: the foreground turn ended and the input
  box came back, but the session is anything but done. So nebula treats an IDLE PROMPT as a hold —
  exactly the hold a gated `Stop` gets — whenever any subagent is still tracked, and only a set that
  has gone quiet is ever presumed orphaned and finished on the strength of it.
- **The STOP GATE's four graces, on a 30 s tick.** A `Stop` (or an IDLE PROMPT) is held while
  `SubagentStart`s outnumber `SubagentStop`s, and a recheck every 30 s — fixed in the DAEMON, with no
  knob to turn it down — decides what becomes of the hold. Once the set drains and stays empty for
  180 s the session is finished; a `SubagentStart` that lands within 30 s of a finish instead heals it
  back to running, on the reading that the `Stop` raced that subagent's own POST. When the set never
  drains, a subagent that has shown no sign of life for 30 min — no `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop`, no
  subagent tool traffic — is presumed killed and the turn finishes anyway. That last grace is why a
  session whose worker died can sit yellow far longer than you expect, and it is generous on purpose:
  one silent `cargo test` can run for many minutes, and a wrong green is the bug it exists to prevent.
  An individually tracked subagent older than 2 h is dropped from the set outright.
- **Answering is a hook too — just not its own.** Approving a permission prompt fires nothing: the
  gated tool simply runs, and its `PostToolUse` is the first word that you said yes. So the
  `PostToolUse` group is unmatched — every tool's end reaches nebula — and a tool event from the same
  origin as the open dialog (the foreground turn, or the one subagent whose prompt it was) moves the
  row from red back to yellow; another subagent's traffic says nothing about a dialog it did not
  raise. An `AskUserQuestion` is answered only by that tool's own `PostToolUse`: Claude runs a question
  alongside the other calls of the response that asked it, so a read-only `Bash` or `Read` batched
  beside it finishes with the question still on screen, and its tool events leave the row red. The
  one signal nebula treats with suspicion is Claude's `permission_prompt` notification: Claude sends
  it from a timer once a dialog has sat 6 s with no keystroke, detached from the turn, and its
  question dialog sends the same type — so one can land just *after* the answer that closed the
  dialog. Inside 5 s of the row leaving red that notification is taken as the echo it is and
  ignored; a genuinely new dialog announces itself through `PermissionRequest` or `PreToolUse`
  first, never through that notification alone.
- **Which of those signals you get depends on the harness.** Claude is installed with all nine hook
  groups — `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, `PermissionRequest`, `Notification`, a
  `PreToolUse` on `AskUserQuestion`, an unmatched `PostToolUse` (the question's answer, a permission
  prompt's approval, and the cwd probe that re-homes a session that moves seconds later instead of
  at the turn's `Stop`), plus `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop`. Codex gets six of them: no
  `Notification` and neither `*ToolUse` group, because it has no `AskUserQuestion` tool and its native
  `PermissionRequest` already covers waiting on you — which also means a Codex row approved out of a
  permission prompt stays red until the turn ends. Cursor gets five camelCase events —
  `sessionStart`, `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `stop`, `subagentStart`, `subagentStop` — and no permission
  event at all; nebula runs `cursor-agent --force`, so waiting-on-you is simply not detectable there
  and a Cursor session never reaches NEEDS FEEDBACK, only busy or idle. Pi runs TypeScript extensions
  instead of shell hooks, so nebula writes one managed extension into its global agent dir
  (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/nebula.ts`, or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/extensions/` — global because pi loads
  those without the trust prompt a per-project `.pi/extensions/` raises) that maps pi's events onto the
  same names: `session_start` → `SessionStart`, `before_agent_start` → `UserPromptSubmit`,
  `agent_end` → `Stop` (it fires on an abort too, so a cancelled pi turn goes green on its own), the
  `ask_question` tool's start and end → `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse`, and a blocking extension prompt
  mid-run → `PermissionRequest`. The file is env-guarded, so a `pi` you run outside nebula loads it and
  does nothing.
- **Sessions title themselves.** Create a session with the default name and the agent renames it after
  your first prompt — a 3-4 word title describing the ask (e.g. `Fix Login Redirect`), via a
  `nebula rename <title>` command the CLI runs in its own turn (no extra API calls, no MCP server).
  Claude Code and Codex get the instruction injected through the `UserPromptSubmit` hook response — as
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, the one envelope both read (the daemon sends it only while the
  session is untitled) — Pi's extension reads the same envelope and appends it to that run's system
  prompt; Cursor gets a managed `.cursor/rules/nebula-title.mdc` project rule instead,
  since its hooks can't inject context. Titling is one-shot and never clobbers a name you typed or set
  with `r` — a late agent attempt is politely declined. `nebula rename --force` overrides.
- **A Claude session's own name and its row stay tied.** `/rename <name>` inside Claude Code retitles
  the row within a moment — the same name then shows in the SESSIONS PANEL, Claude's prompt box, its
  `/resume` picker and `/rc` list, and survives a restart. Claude fires no hook for `/rename`; it
  rewrites the window title (`✳ <name>`) and writes `custom-title.json` beside the transcript, so the
  DAEMON reads that file when the PTY's title changes (and on every hook), and adopts a title Claude
  did not hold before as if you had pressed `r`. The other way round, a name set in nebula — typed at
  creation, set with `r`, or chosen by AUTO-TITLE — reaches Claude on your next prompt through the
  same `UserPromptSubmit` hook reply, as `hookSpecificOutput.sessionTitle`. Whichever side changed
  last wins; a name you set in nebula is never undone by re-reading Claude's older one. Claude only —
  Codex and Cursor have no session name of their own.
- **Rows can list what they were last asked.** With **Recent prompts** on (Settings → Experimental),
  the `prompt` field of the `UserPromptSubmit` payload — which every harness sends — is condensed to
  one line in the hook receiver, kept on the AGENT row (the newest ten, in SQLite) and drawn under its
  pill in the SESSIONS PANEL with an ago label, newest last. Pure capture: nothing is injected into the
  model's context and no extra turn runs. See [Sessions](sessions.md#recent-prompts).
- **Ask the agent for a worktree and it moves there.** Tell a Claude session "do this in a worktree" and
  it runs `nebula worktree <name>` instead of its own `EnterWorktree` tool (whose checkouts land under
  `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/` on a `worktree-*` branch). nebula creates the checkout in its usual
  `<repo-name>-worktrees/<branch>` spot — or takes the existing one for that branch — re-homes the
  session's row under it at once, and the moment that turn ends restarts the CLI resumed inside the
  worktree, opening with a note saying where it now runs, so the conversation carries on there without
  you typing anything. Claude learns the rule from a short `--append-system-prompt` nebula passes at
  spawn, plus a `Bash(nebula worktree:*)` permission so the command never prompts; Pi gets the same
  appended prompt and reopens on the same note. Codex, Cursor and Muse have no system-prompt flag to learn
  the rule from, but run the same command when you ask. Codex then reopens on the same note —
  `codex resume <id> --cd <worktree> "<note>"`, the `--cd` because Codex otherwise reopens a resumed
  session in the directory its transcript recorded, the old checkout. Cursor resumes silent and waits
  for your next prompt; Muse reboots fresh with no note (no resume flag mapped). The restart is the only way there: an agent CLI can't `cd` out of the
  directory it was started in.
- **Ask the agent for another session and it starts one.** Tell a Claude session "start a new nebula
  session that fixes the login redirect" and it runs `nebula spawn "<task>"`: the daemon starts a second
  agent beside it — same worktree, same harness, model and effort unless `--kind claude|codex|cursor|pi|muse|grok`
  names another — opening on that task as its first prompt, so it is working before you look. The new
  row appears in the sessions list on its own (default name, so it titles itself), and the session you
  asked from is untouched: no restart, no focus change. Claude learns this from the same appended system
  prompt as the worktree rule, plus a `Bash(nebula spawn:*)` permission.
- **Ask the agent to show you a file and it opens in nebula.** Say "open it" or "show me the examples"
  and the session runs `nebula open <file>…`; every TUI attached to the daemon raises its file tabs on
  them — a modal with one tab per file, the focused one previewed with syntax highlighting, `Enter`
  editing it in place — so the agent puts the file in front of you instead of pasting it into the
  reply. Only when you ask: the appended prompt forbids opening anything unprompted, so an agent that
  wants you to look at its work names the path and waits. And text only: the CLI resolves the paths
  against the session's own directory and refuses a path that isn't there or isn't a text file (a NUL
  byte in its first 8 KiB, git's own test — a terminal has nothing to show for a PNG); the daemon only
  checks the caller is a known session and passes the agent's checkout along as the editor's working
  directory. Same appended prompt, plus a `Bash(nebula open:*)` permission.
- **Everything persists in SQLite** (`~/.local/share/nebula/nebula.db` or the platform equivalent):
  projects, worktrees, agents (with kind + CLI session ids), links, workspaces, and your
  last selection.
- **Sessions warm up, then get reaped.** The daemon can pre-spawn an agent CLI in the selected worktree
  before you ask for one, and pre-boot a worktree's dead sessions while your selection rests on it, so attaching
  lands on a booted screen instead of a booting shell. To bound what that costs, idle PTYs in worktrees
  no client is watching are killed after `session_idle_timeout` (5m by default) — working agents, ones
  waiting on you, and terminals with a command running are all spared, and a reaped agent
  revives on the next attach with its conversation resumed. Until then its row's STATUS DOT is gray,
  whatever its last status was — a cold session shows what it last did, not what it is doing. Both halves of the PREWARM POOL are
  switchable — `prewarm_agents` and `prewarm_sessions`, `true` by default, on the SETTINGS OVERLAY's
  Sessions tab or by hand in CONFIG.JSON (see [Configuration](configuration.md)); switching the pool
  off drains its spares on the next sweep — and a warm spare nobody claims inside 15 min is reaped on
  its own, because it holds real memory and its context goes stale. A spare is a bare CLI at its
  prompt, so the CLI's own session list (Claude's `/list-agents`) shows it beside your sessions,
  named after the directory. The IDLE REAPER's check is a 15 s sweep (`NEBULA_IDLE_REAP_MS`), so the real
  latency is the timeout plus up to 15 s more; `session_idle_timeout` also takes `"off"`, which
  switches reaping off entirely.

## Pull requests

nebula finds the pull request on each branch with `gh` and shows it in the Sessions panel's
PULL REQUESTS group, including a count of comments that landed while you were away. The row outlives
the pull request: once it is merged or closed the row stays, badged `merged` or `closed` (an open one is
badged `ready` — ready for review, the state and nothing more — and a draft is dimmed and badged `draft`),
for as long as the checkout does — a worktree whose PR has shipped is the one
you are about to archive or delete, and the PR is what you check first. A merged one also takes over the
checkout's row in the Worktrees panel: purple dot, purple rail, and the branch name sweeping the way a
running row's does, so the checkout to delete stands out from across the room (a session still running
or asking there keeps its yellow or red — that is not a checkout to pull out from under it). Rest on that
row and the pane reads the pull request — description, stats, conversation — exactly as it does for the
project-wide OPEN PRS rows under the worktrees, which do retire on merge (and which the `hide_draft_prs`
setting can thin to the non-drafts — this row is never thinned, it is the checkout's own); `g` shows its diff. Manual link
attachment is currently unavailable; previously saved links remain visible so the change does not
discard data.

This is the one part of nebula the TUI asks for itself rather than the DAEMON: every `gh pr view`,
`gh pr list` and `gh pr diff` — and the ISSUES MODAL's `gh issue list` and `gh issue view` — is spawned by the client, which is why the lookups stop the moment you
quit, and why a machine with no `gh` — or one that is unauthenticated, or pointed at a checkout with no
remote — just shows no rows instead of an error. Only the selected project is ever asked about: its
selected worktree's PR ROW and its PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP on every tick, one process each, and its other
checkouts on a sweep that takes one of them per tick — so every worktree row learns whether its branch
has merged without the cursor ever visiting it (the ROOT WORKTREE is left out; nobody deletes it over a
merge). Nothing is stacked while a call is in flight, and each is abandoned after 20 s. The selected
worktree and the open list settle onto a steady 15 s beat; the swept checkouts onto 5 min, since a
merge reaches them sooner anyway — the moment a pull request drops out of the open list, the checkout on
its branch is asked again on the next tick, and turns purple seconds after the merge. An empty answer
backs off by doubling — out to 3 min for a branch that never grows a PR, 10 min for a project with none
open — so a workspace of thirty repos does not cost thirty API calls a beat. Focusing a sidebar panel or
the terminal window pulls the next lookup forward, floored at a few seconds; `Shift+R` is the one
gesture that asks straight away, every checkout of the project included.

Settings and hotkeys live in [Configuration](configuration.md). The process model, the IPC CODEC and
the crate layout are covered in more depth in [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md).
