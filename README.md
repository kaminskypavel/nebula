**Mission control for your coding agents.**

Run **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, **Pi**, **Muse** and **Grok Build** across every project and git WORKTREE you own — from one
terminal, one keyboard, one tree. They keep working when you close it.

## Three agents, three tabs, and no idea which one needs you

You start three agents in three terminal tabs. Five minutes later you don't know which one is waiting on
a permission prompt, which one finished, and which one is still thinking — so you tab through all three,
every time, and read the screens. Start a fourth and you aren't running more agents, you're doing a worse
job of watching the ones you have.

nebula replaces the reading with a tree and a color. Every PROJECT, WORKTREE and SESSION is a row; every
SESSION carries a STATUS DOT that says what it's doing; and every parent ROLLS UP its children, so a red
dot on a collapsed PROJECT tells you exactly where to look without opening anything.

**No Electron, no browser, no server, no MCP.** One ~4 MB Rust binary and a unix socket.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **One tree, up to four PANELS** | PROJECTS → WORKTREES → SESSIONS → TERMINAL PANE. `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` moves, `Enter` drills in, and landing on a live pane hands it the keyboard — so `Tab` all the way right and start typing at the agent. |
| **A DAEMON that owns the PTYs** | Quit the TUI, shut the laptop, come back tomorrow. The agents never stopped, and the SCROLLBACK RING is replayed on ATTACH. |
| **STATUS DOTS you read instead of screens** | ● yellow mid-turn, ● violet finished and UNSEEN, ● green finished and read, ● red waiting on you — plus a violet `n done` DONE BADGE counting the terminals you still owe a look. |
| **Lists that order themselves** | PROJECTS, WORKTREES and SESSIONS all sit most-recent-first in RECENCY ORDER, with a dim `23m ago` after the name saying why the row is where it is. The one fixed seat is the ROOT WORKTREE, always the first WORKTREES PANEL row; nothing else is pinned or dragged into place by hand. |
| **Real git WORKTREES, one keystroke** | `n` in the WORKTREES PANEL branches off into an actual `git worktree`. Two agents in two directories never collide. A WORKTREE HOOK in git config lets a project claim a port or a route when a checkout is created and release it when it is deleted. |
| **The root checkout on any branch, no shell** | `c` on the ROOT WORKTREE lists every branch and remote branch, fuzzy-filtered as you type; `Enter` switches, or creates the branch when nothing matches. Uncommitted changes? The BRANCH SWITCHER asks first — stash them, bring them along, commit them, or discard them — the way an IDE would. |
| **Agents that drive nebula back** | Tell a Claude SESSION *"do this in a worktree"* and it runs `nebula worktree`, then restarts itself resumed inside the new checkout. Say *"show me the file"* and `nebula open` puts it in front of you in a tabbed modal. Say *"start a new nebula session that…"* and `nebula spawn` has a second agent working beside it before you look. |
| **Every open pull request, in place** | nebula asks `gh` what's still open on the repo. Rest on a PR ROW and the PR PREVIEW reads it to you — description, stats, the whole conversation. `g` for its diff, `Enter` for the browser, `n` for a SESSION on any harness, scoped to that PR. |
| **Every open issue, one key from an agent** | `i` lists the project's open GitHub issues, newest first, and reads the one under the cursor — description, labels, comments. `Enter` opens a QUICK PROMPT for it, `e` launches one of your AGENT PRESETS on it; the issue's URL travels with the session as context on every spawn, so the harness knows what it is fixing. |
| **Diff, find, grep, browse** | `g` opens the DIFF VIEWER with REVIEWED MARKS, `f` the FILE FINDER, `F` a `git grep`, `b` the TREE BROWSER — all scoped to the selected WORKTREE, all one key from anywhere. |
| **`/` finds anything, anywhere** | The PALETTE spans every WORKSPACE, not just the open one. Before you type it sorts by attention: NEEDS FEEDBACK first, then RUNNING, then UNSEEN — so `/` `Enter` is the fastest way back to whatever needs you, and `]` / `[` cycle that same attention order with no modal at all, one session per press, workspaces included. Open pull requests are rows too: `Enter` on one lands on its PR ROW with the PR PREVIEW reading it, `Ctrl+o` hands it to the browser. |
| **It follows you to other machines** | `nebula ssh <host>` opens nebula there, installing it if missing. `nebula tunnel <host>` puts that machine's TUI in a browser tab over a single ssh tunnel. Your settings and agent presets go along, and `nebula config export` / `import` back them up. |

## Supported harnesses

Six CLIs work out of the box, each with its own Agents tab section and model/effort rows. Install the CLI,
pick it in the `n` picker, done. A CLI missing from PATH still shows in the picker; the DAEMON
re-checks through the login shell at launch.

## Install

macOS or Linux — the same command installs and updates:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgentSystemLabs/nebula/main/install.sh | sh
```

It downloads the prebuilt binary for your platform from the latest GitHub release into `~/.local/bin`
(override with `NEBULA_INSTALL_DIR`), falling back to `cargo install --git` when no release matches.
Afterwards, `nebula upgrade` runs that same script for you; it refuses to clobber a local `cargo build`
(pass `--force` if you mean it). Upgrading with a DAEMON running is safe: an idle one — nothing live in
it — is shut down for you, so the next launch comes up on the new binary. A DAEMON with live SESSIONS is
left alone and they keep running the old binary until you `nebula kill` and relaunch — unless the new
build speaks a different protocol, in which case it can't attach until that restart, and `nebula upgrade`
says so and offers to do it for you. `nebula --version`
(`-V`) says which binary you are on.

> **Prerequisite:** at least one agent CLI on your `PATH` — `claude`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`, `pi`, `muse`, or `grok`.
> nebula spawns them; it doesn't ship them.
>
> Three commands each want one more binary, and only those commands: `nebula ssh` and `nebula tunnel`
> exit if there is no OpenSSH client (`ssh`), and `nebula browser` needs `ttyd` on your `PATH` — for
> `nebula tunnel` it is the *remote* host that needs it. The TUI itself needs neither.

## Quickstart

**1. Add a repo.** nebula is project-first, and a PROJECT is just a git checkout:

```sh
nebula add ~/code/my-app       # or, from inside the repo: nebula add .
```

**2. Open the TUI.** A bare `nebula` launches it and auto-starts the DAEMON:

```sh
nebula
```

`Tab` / `Shift+Tab` (or `h` / `l`) move FOCUS between PANELS, `j` / `k` move the selection inside one, and
`Enter` drills in. With no PROJECTS yet you get the SPLASH — press `n` to add one without leaving the TUI.

**3. Pick where the agent runs.** Every PROJECT starts with one WORKTREE: the checkout itself. Press `n`
in the WORKTREES PANEL to branch off into a real `git worktree`. That's the whole point of the column —
two agents in two WORKTREES edit two directories and never collide.

**4. Start the agent.** `n` in the SESSIONS PANEL opens the NEW SESSION PICKER — **Claude**, **Codex**,
**Cursor**, **Pi**, **Muse** or **Grok Build**, `→` for MODEL and EFFORT, `Enter` for your defaults — then type the agent's first prompt
in the box that follows (or `Enter` on it empty to start in the CLI). Or skip the picker entirely: `p` from any
PANEL opens the QUICK PROMPT, you type the task, and an agent starts working on it in the selected
WORKTREE — or, from the WORKTREES PANEL or with `Ctrl+N` inside the box, in a fresh worktree cut for the
job, the box turning green to say so. Save a framing you keep retyping as an AGENT PRESET (`e`) and it
becomes one keystroke.

**5. Walk away.** `Ctrl+q` leaves the TERMINAL PANE for the panels; `q` asks first — a CONFIRM DIALOG
reading *Leave the TUI? Sessions keep running in the daemon.* that `Enter` accepts and a second `Ctrl+C`
walks straight through. The DAEMON still owns every PTY — come back with `nebula` an hour later and each
SESSION is exactly where you left it, scrollback replayed.

A new SESSION starts on a default name and AUTO-TITLE renames it from your first prompt — `Fix Login
Redirect`, not `agent-3`; `r` renames it whenever you like. A Claude SESSION's own name
is the same name: `/rename` inside Claude Code retitles the row, and a name set in nebula reaches
Claude's prompt box and `/resume` picker on your next prompt.

## Read the dots, not the screens

| Dot | AGENT STATUS |
|---|---|
| ● gray | FRESH — agent never run |
| ● yellow | RUNNING — turn in progress (the STOP GATE holds it open while subagents are live) |
| ● violet | UNSEEN — turn complete and nobody has looked at it yet |
| ● green | FINISHED — the same finished turn, once the cursor has been on the SESSION |
| ● red | NEEDS FEEDBACK — permission prompt or question waiting on you |
| ● magenta | terminated — process died mid-run |
| ○ | disconnected — the DAEMON restarted while the agent was live |

A Cursor SESSION never goes red: nebula runs `cursor-agent --force` and Cursor reports no permission
event, so waiting-on-you is not detectable there. A Muse SESSION never goes red either yet: `muse`
has no managed hooks, so its status is process-based until a hook dialect is mapped. Grok Build also uses process-based status,
with no managed hooks or automatic capture of its session ID yet. Model and effort IDs can be
set through `harnesses.grok` in config.json; the CLI supplies their defaults when unset.

WORKTREE and PROJECT rows ROLL UP their children: red beats yellow beats done, and a parent's dot is
violet whenever anything UNSEEN finished under it — so the violet walks up the tree and turns green as
you read your way down it.

A dot going violet while you were looking elsewhere is easy to miss, so nebula counts those for you. When
a turn finishes in a pane that isn't on screen, its WORKTREE and PROJECT rows grow a violet `n done`
DONE BADGE — the number of terminals you have left to go read — and the SESSION row says `done` where its
HARNESS BADGE normally sits. Walking the cursor onto a SESSION previews it, which reads it: the badges
count down as you go and disappear at zero — `]` walks you onto the next one owed a look without hunting
for it. The flag lives in the DAEMON, so it survives closing the TUI
and is shared by every client; a turn that finishes in the pane you're already looking at never counts.

A dot going red is the one you can't afford to miss — a blocked agent burns the clock while you're in
another window — so that one reaches you: the FEEDBACK SOUND rings (`Sosumi` by default, distinct from
the `Glass` DONE SOUND a finish gets), and when the terminal window is in the background a desktop
notification names the session and its worktree. Neither fires for the pane you're locked into typing
at with the window focused — that prompt is already under your hands. One setting, `feedback_sound`,
owns both; `off` silences the pair. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Where the status actually comes from

nebula doesn't poll the agents and it doesn't guess from the screen. At spawn it merges MANAGED HOOKS
into the WORKTREE's `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.cursor/hooks.json` or `~/.codex/hooks.json` — tagged
`_nebulaManaged`, your own hooks preserved, rebuilt every spawn — and each one is a fail-soft `curl` to
the DAEMON's loopback HOOK RECEIVER, authenticated with a per-boot BEARER TOKEN. Pi has no shell hooks,
so it gets one managed extension at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/nebula.ts` that posts the same events. For the one event no CLI
reports — a turn you cancelled with `Esc` — the PROGRESS SCANNER reads the CLI's own OSC 9;4 progress
escapes straight off the PTY, a signal that survives the cancel and stays busy while a permission prompt
is open.

## Teach nebula a new agent CLI

The six built-ins are just rows in a table, and the table is open. One block in `config.json` adds
a CLI everywhere at once: the `n` picker, the `e` presets, spawn, resume, and the Agents tab, which
grows it a section to tune without hand-editing.

```json
{
  "harnesses": {
    "mycli": {
      "program": "mycli",
      "model_flag": "--model",
      "model_default": "large",
      "hooks": "claude"
    }
  }
}
```

`program` is the only required row: the binary nebula launches, resolved on PATH through your login
shell. A new id starts enabled, takes the id as its label, boots fresh every launch (no resume), and
hides the Effort row until you map effort. `nebula config harnesses` prints the effective rows to copy
from, and a block that stops making sense refuses its launches with the reason while everything else
keeps working. Ids use lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, and must not collide with a built-in.

`hooks` names a built-in dialect, not your own scripts: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor` or `pi`. At spawn
nebula installs that dialect's MANAGED HOOKS for the session (the same `.claude/settings.local.json`,
`.cursor/hooks.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json` or pi extension the built-in gets), so a CLI that speaks
that protocol reports status, prompts and permission waits exactly like the real thing. A
Claude-compatible CLI with `"hooks": "claude"` even gets title sync and auto-title. Leave `hooks` out
and the sessions stay process-based: running while the PTY is live, never red. Either way your own
hooks are preserved (nebula's entries are tagged `_nebulaManaged`) and the merge is rebuilt every
spawn.

One boundary to know: `nebula ssh` syncs `config.json` to the remote, but exec-capable harness keys
never travel with it: each machine runs only the programs its own files name. Full row reference
(resume styles, effort mapping, system-prompt passing, clearing a row with `null`): [Configuration](docs/configuration.md),
"The harness registry".

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release     # → target/release/nebula (~4 MB)
cargo test                # unit + end-to-end suite (spawns real daemons/PTYs)
```

`nebula-core` (shared protocol/entities), `nebula-daemon` (PTYs, SQLite, HOOK RECEIVER, STATUS MACHINE),
`nebula-tui` (ratatui client), `nebula` (the binary). `vendor/vt100` is a patched copy of the terminal
parser wired in through `[patch.crates-io]`: rows scrolled out of a top-anchored scroll region go to the
SCROLLBACK RING instead of being discarded, so wheel-up over a codex SESSION has something to show.

Releases: push a `v*` tag (`git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags`) and CI builds mac (arm/intel) and linux (x64/arm64, static musl) binaries and
attaches them to a GitHub release — which is what `install.sh` downloads.
